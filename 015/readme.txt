Lattice paths
Problem 15 
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

1. (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(1,2)->(2,2)
2. (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)
3. (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)
4. (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)
5. (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)
6. (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(2,1)->(2,2)

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
